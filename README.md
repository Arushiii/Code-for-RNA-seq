# Code-for-RNA-seq

Gene Expression analysis of RNA-Seq 

 Utilized raw count matrix, performed expression analysis using DESeq2.
 Generated R script, for visualization and analysing using volcano plot, heatmap, PCA, and Boxplot.
 Worked on TPM matrix and coded in python for finding values like p-value, FDR, log2Fold change.
 Found 600 significant genes using cutoff for FDR ≤ 0.05, |fold-change| ≥ 2 and got 250 (upregulated gene) and 350(downregulated genes).
